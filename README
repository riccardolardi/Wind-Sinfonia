Air as a tool for data visualization

Video: http://vimeo.com/35274621

This project aimed to experiment with air as a tool for data visualization. How can air be used to present information in a artistically compelling way? Can variable air pressure be used for such a task? We ended up creating a two part system: the interface, in which can be blown into, and the visualization output, which will represent the pattern of air pressure recored by the interface.
